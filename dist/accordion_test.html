                THC and CBD are two cannabinoids of the cannabis plant and they function in very different but complementary ways.</br></br> THC is known as a mind altering, intoxicating cannabinoid, and it’s the one that most people think of when they think of ‘getting high’ on cannabis.</br></br> Most people who come into a cannabis dispensary looking for high THC products are looking to feel a very strong, intoxicating effect but right now, licensed producers in Canada are creating a broad range of low THC products for cannabis consumers as well. From low THC pre rolls to low THC beverages, the market is seeing a lot of great new products hit the shelves. The reason these products are popular is because they don’t tend to have effects that are overly intoxicating, so they allow novice users to avoid feelings of paranoia after consuming cannabis.</br></br> On the other hand, CBD is known to be a non intoxicating cannabinoid which has become very popular with people who want to avoid the intoxicating effects of THC but believe that cannabis, and CBD especially has certain benefits for them. Licensed producers in Canada have developed a large range of CBD products from CBD capsules, to CBD sprays, CBD drinks. CBD teas and CBD pre rolls.
